When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Keeping a remote repository is helpful in case your computer crashes. You don't want to lose all your files.
Having them somewhere else is a hlepful backup. A remote repository is also helpful if you are collaborating on projects. Since
not all contributors are able to be in the same place at the same time, it is helpful to have a place to keep all the times online.
This also allows other users to have versions of their own programs without interferring with your own.
